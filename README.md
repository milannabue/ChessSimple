## Known Issues:
* Canceling a game does not stop the names from displaying on the leaderboard with a score of zero. Only seen in the scenario that a player cancels a game when there's an empty/low number of people on the leaderboard.
* Canceling the input of a name causes strange behavior of the timer. Only seen if a player cancels the input of a name and clicks on the pause button instead of somewhere else on the screen. 
* No feature to deny promotion. Incredibly unlikely scenario.
* No en passant feature.
